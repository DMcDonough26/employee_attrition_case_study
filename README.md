# employee_attrition_case_study
People analytics case study focused on identifying potential factors of employee attrition.

This project was a case study in a job interview based on the simulated employee attrition data from IBM. The goal was to be able to explain potential factors of attrition, and the expectation was that inferential statistics would be used to develop these recommendations.

I've included the original data, the powerpoint presentation covering findings, and the jupyter notebook to support the slides.
